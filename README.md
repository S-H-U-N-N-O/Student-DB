To run this program without any errors, download xampp or wamp in your computer. Run it and log in to PHPMYADMIN database.

Now if you are totally new and can't commit changes in the code make a database in the "srs". Then make a table named "info". Inside "info" make 6 columns with the following names. "name", "roll", "sec", "cls", "id", "cn".

Then run the program.
